> PROBLEM STATEMENT TAKEN:
Create a Platform for Small-Scale Farmers to Access Market and Pricing Information:
Establishing a platform for small-scale farmers to access market and pricing information serves as a vital support for the agricultural community. The platform incorporates real-time data on market trends, commodity prices, and demand forecasts. It provides small farmers with equitable access to information that larger agricultural enterprises already possess. Mobile apps and web interfaces ensure easy access, and SMS alerts can reach those without internet connectivity. Empowering small-scale farmers with market insights enables better decision-making regarding crop choices and pricing negotiations. Ultimately, it helps bridge the information gap, reduces exploitation, and contributes to the financial stability of smallholder farmers
